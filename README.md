# Manzoori (ਮੰਜੂਰੀ) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/metaware/manzoori.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/metaware/manzoori) [![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/metaware/pravangi/badges/gpa.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/metaware/manzoori)

ਮੰਜੂਰੀ (manzoori) : Let's you add an approval process on top of your models/objects. Assume you have an object which is in an `approved` state, you want any subsequent changes to this model to go into a review queue and have someone review these changes until they are actually committed to the object.

## Installation

### Rails 3 & 4

1. Add `manzoori` to your `Gemfile`.

    `gem 'manzoori'`

2. Generate a migration which will add a `pending_approvals` table to your database.

    `bundle exec rails generate manzoori:install`

3. Run the migration.

    `bundle exec rake db:migrate`

4. Add `requires_approval` to the models you want to track.

## API Summary

When you declare `requires_approval` in your model, you get these methods:

```ruby
class Article < ActiveRecord::Base
  requires_approval if: :approved?, 
    manzoori_history: :object_diff,
    skip_attributes: [:updated_at, :created_at],
    tracked_methods: :author_name
end

# check if this object requires any approval?
article.pending_approval?
```

```ruby
# require approval when changed
article = Article.new(title: 'The Illuminati')
article.save

article.title = 'Title that should go through an approval process'
article.save

article.title 
=> 'The Illuminate'
'The Illuminati'

article.pending_approval? 
=> true

article.pending_approvals.last.object_changes 
=> {"title"=>["The Illuminati", "Title that should go through an approval process"] }

article.pending_approvals.last.approve_changes
article.title
=> "Title that should go through an approval process"

article.pending_approvals.last.reject_changes
article.title
=> "The Illuminati"

article.pending_approvals?
=> false
```

```ruby
class Article < ActiveRecord::Base
  requires_approval skip_attributes: [:updated_at, :created_at]
end

article.touch
article.pending_approvals?
=> false
```

```ruby
class Article < ActiveRecord::Base
  requires_approval if: :author_is_reviewer?, skip_attributes: [:updated_at, :created_at]

  def author_is_reviewer?
    author.role == 'reviewer'
  end

end

admin = Author.new(name: 'Jasdeep', role: 'admin')
article = Article.new(title: 'The Illuminati', author: admin)
article.save

article.title = 'Some New Title'
article.save
=> true

article.title
=> 'Some New Title'
```
